# clipper2-src

Rust packaging of [Clipper2](https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2) — a polygon clipping and offsetting library.

Clipper2 performs boolean operations (intersection, union, difference, XOR) on polygons and polylines, as well as polygon offsetting. It's the successor to the original Clipper library, with improved performance and precision.

This crate provides the C++ source and build integration for use in Rust projects, targeting recent Clipper2 versions (currently 2.0.1).
